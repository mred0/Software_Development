## Unit 6 – Exploring Python Functions

In Unit 6, we learned about Python functions and how they help in organizing code properly.  
The main focus of this unit was to understand how functions improve code structure, reusability, and maintainability.

### Task Overview
For the consolidated task, a simple **To-Do List Manager** program was created using Python functions.  
The program was divided into different functions to handle specific tasks.

### Functions Used
- Add a new task
- Mark a task as completed
- Display all tasks
- Menu to interact with the program

### Learning Outcomes
This task helped in:
- Understanding how to define and use functions in Python
- Breaking a problem into smaller reusable parts
- Writing cleaner and more maintainable code
- Getting practical experience with function-based programming

Overall, this unit improved practical coding skills and understanding of Python functions.
