## Unit 2 – Introduction To Software Versioning

## Task - Creating a software repository
1.The software repository should be called 'My first software development repository'
2.You should add a short description to the repository, e.g. 'This software repository contains my first software for the module Software Development. It stores all of the related files including a README file which contains information about the software I have written.'
3.Create the repository
4.Create a new branch called 'software edits'
5.Under the software-edits branch click on the README file and add in some comments about you as a software developer and what you have learned so far about software versioning
6.Click 'commit changes'
7.In the 'propose changes' box, add in a comment to say you have edited the README with personal information
8.Click on the pull requests tab of your 'My first software development repository' tab
9.Click 'new pull request'
10.In the 'example comparisons' box choose the branch you just made, 'software edits', to compare with the 'main' branch
11.Check the changes in the compare page to make sure they are correct.
12.Click 'create pull request'
13.Enter a name and a brief description for changes.
14.Click 'create pull request'
