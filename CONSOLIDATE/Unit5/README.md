## Unit 5 - Code Comments and Python Pre-built Packages

## Task - Create Simple Code or Utility Programme
For a consolidated task in code commenting and Python's built-in packages, students can collaborate to create a shared Python codebase for a simple game or utility program. 
They should use extensive comments to explain the code's functionality, making it easy for others to understand and modify. 
Furthermore, students should leverage Python's standard libraries to optimize the code's performance and functionality. 

 -- Here, We Created Simple Guesse Number Game Between 1 to 10.
