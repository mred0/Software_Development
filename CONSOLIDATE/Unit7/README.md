## Unit 7 – Concept of Iteration (Looping) in Programming

In Unit 7, we learned about Iteration(loop) structures in Python and how they are used to repeat actions based on conditions.

### Task Overview
For this unit, a simple game called **Guess the Number** was created.  
The program repeatedly asks the user to guess a number until the correct number is guessed or the maximum number of attempts is reached.

### Concepts Used
- While loop
- User input handling
- Conditional statements
- Limited number of attempts

### Learning Outcomes
This task helped in:
- Understanding how loops work in Python
- Repeating actions until a condition is met
- Building interactive programs
- Improving logical thinking using conditions and loops

Overall, this unit reinforced the practical use of loops in real scenarios.
