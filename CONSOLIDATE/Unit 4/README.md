## Task - Create Simple Inventory Management System.
For a consolidated task in variable exploration, design a Python program that simulates a simple inventory management system. 
They should use various data types to store product names, quantities, and prices, and implement functionality to update and display this information. 
Additionally, students can explore file handling to persistently store the inventory data in a text or CSV file, allowing them to practice data persistence techniques in Python.

 -- Here, We Created Invetory management for Fruits Added it's variables like Name, Price And Quantity.
