## Unit 8 – Recursion in Python

In Unit 8, we learned about recursion and how a function can call itself to solve a problem.

### Task Overview
For this unit, a coding challenge was completed using a recursive algorithm.  
The classic **Fibonacci number** problem was implemented using recursion.

### Concepts Used
- Recursive functions
- Base cases in recursion
- Function calls
- Problem solving using recursion

### Learning Outcomes
This task helped in:
- Understanding how recursion works in Python
- Learning the importance of base cases to stop infinite calls
- Seeing how recursion can solve problems in a simple way
- Understanding performance issues if recursion is not handled properly

Overall, this unit improved understanding of recursive problem solving.
